Given a posts table that contains a created_at timestamp column write a query that returns date (without time component), 
a number of posts for a given date and a running (cumulative) total number of posts up until a given date. 
he resulting set should be ordered chronologically by date.										
				
        
Solution - 
 SELECT
  CREATED_AT::DATE AS DATE
  ,COUNT(CREATED_AT) AS COUNT
  ,SUM(COUNT(CREATED_AT)) OVER (ORDER BY CREATED_AT::DATE ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)::INT AS TOTAL
FROM POSTS
GROUP BY CREATED_AT::DATE

Solution - Window Function Practice
WITH cte AS(
      SELECT 
        DATE(created_at) AS date,COUNT(*)::INT AS count 
      FROM posts
      GROUP BY date ORDER BY date)
    ,cte1 AS (
        SELECT 
          date
          ,count
          ,(SUM(count) OVER (ORDER BY date ASC rows between unbounded preceding and current row)) AS total 
        FROM cte)

SELECT 
  date
  ,count
  ,total
FROM cte1
