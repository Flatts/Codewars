--Given film_actor and film tables from the DVD Rental sample database 
--find all movies both Sidney Crowe (actor_id = 105) and Salma Nolte (actor_id = 122) cast in together 
--and order the result set alphabetically.						


--Solution 
SELECT 
  f.title
FROM film f
  JOIN film_actor fa on fa.film_id = f.film_id
WHERE fa.actor_id IN (105,122)
GROUP BY f.film_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 2
ORDER BY f.title ASC
