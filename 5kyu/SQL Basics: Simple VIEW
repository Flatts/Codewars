For this challenge you need to create a VIEW. 
This VIEW is used by a sales store to give out vouches to members who have spent over $1000 in departments
that have brought in more than $10000 total ordered by the members id. 
The VIEW must be called members_approved_for_voucher then you must create a SELECT query using the view.

resultant table schema
id
name
email
total_spending

Solution
CREATE VIEW members_approved_for_voucher AS
WITH dep_ok AS(
  SELECT 
    s.department_id
    ,SUM(p.price) 
  FROM sales s
    JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.id
  GROUP BY s.department_id
  HAVING SUM(p.price) > 10000
  )
SELECT
  s.member_id AS id
  ,m.name
  ,m.email
  ,SUM(p.price) AS total_spending
FROM sales s
  INNER JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.id
  INNER JOIN members m ON s.member_id = m.id
WHERE s.department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM dep_ok)
GROUP BY s.member_id,m.name,m.email
HAVING SUM(p.price) > 1000
ORDER BY s.member_id
;
