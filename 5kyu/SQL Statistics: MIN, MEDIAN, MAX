--Your task is to calculate the MIN, MEDIAN and MAX scores of the students from the results table.

--Resultant table: min, median, max

--Solution:

SELECT		
    SUM(min)/2   AS min
    ,SUM(score)/2 AS median
    ,SUM(max)/2   AS max		
FROM(		
     SELECT		
        SCORE
        ,min
        ,max
        ,ROW_NUM
        ,row_count		
     FROM(		
	      SELECT	
	        score::FLOAT
          ,(MIN(score) OVER ())::INT AS min
          ,COUNT(*) OVER() AS row_count
          ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SCORE) AS ROW_NUM
          ,(MAX(score) OVER())::INT AS max	
	      FROM result) x	
	WHERE	
	ROW_NUM IN ((row_count+2)/2,(row_count)/2)	
	)y
