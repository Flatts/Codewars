--Your manager has given you a task to create a report to measure the impact of the next company-wide salary increase.
--The rules for the salary increase are encapsulated in the function pctIncrease,
--    which takes a department_id as a parameter and returns the percent increase as a value between 0 and 1.

--You've managed to create a query that would produce the desired results, 
--    but it is currently very slow and doesn't finish in the required time window.

--Your objective in this kata is to optimize this query.
--The success criteria is to manage to run the query within 
--    the allowed kata solution time window (12 seconds for SQL katas).

--The provided initial solution produces the correct result, but it does not run within the allowed time window.

--Solution:
WITH Factor AS (
  SELECT 
    d.department_id
    ,d.department_name
    ,1 + pctIncrease(d.department_id)::float AS new_factor
  FROM 
    departments d )

SELECT 
  e.employee_id
  ,e.first_name
  ,e.last_name
  ,f.department_name
  ,e.salary AS old_salary
  ,e.salary * f.new_factor AS new_salary 
FROM 
  factor f
JOIN employees e ON e.department_id = f.department_id
ORDER BY 1;
