--For this challenge you need to create a RECURSIVE Hierarchical query. 
--You have a table employees of employees, you must order each employee by level. 
--You must use a WITH statement and name it employee_levels 
--  after that has been defined you must select from it.

--A Level is in correlation what manager managers the employee. 
--e.g. an employee with a manager_id of NULL is at level 1 
--and then direct employees with the employee at level 1 will be level 2.

--employees table schema: id, first_name, last_name, manager_id (can be NULL), 
--resultant schema: level, id, first_name, last_name, manager_id (can be NULL)

--Solution: 
WITH RECURSIVE employee_levels AS (		
	SELECT	
		id
    ,first_name
    ,last_name
    ,manager_id
    ,1 AS level
	FROM 
    employees	
	WHERE
    manager_id IS NULL	
	UNION	
	SELECT	
		e.id
    ,e.first_name
    ,e.last_name
    ,e.manager_id
    ,el.level+1 AS level
	FROM 
    employees e	
	INNER JOIN employee_levels el ON el.id = e.manager_id )	

SELECT 
  level
  ,id
  ,first_name
  ,last_name
  ,manager_id		
FROM
  employee_levels		
;
