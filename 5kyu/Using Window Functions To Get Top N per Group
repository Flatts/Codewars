--Given the schema presented below write a query, which uses a window function,
--  that returns two most viewed posts for every category.

--Order the result set by:
--category name alphabetically
--number of post views largest to lowest
--post id lowest to largest
--Note: Some categories may have less than two or no posts at all.
--    Two or more posts within the category can be tied by (have the same) the number of views. 
--    Use post id as a tie breaker - a post with a lower id gets a higher rank.

--Categories Table: id, category
--Posts Table: id, category_id, title, views
--Return Table: category_id, category, title, views, post_id

--Solution:

WITH post_rank AS (
  SELECT
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.id ORDER BY views DESC,p.id)
    ,c.id AS cat_id
    ,c.category AS category
    ,title
    ,views
    ,p.id AS post_id
  FROM 
    categories c
LEFT JOIN posts p ON p.category_id =  c.id )

SELECT 
  cat_id AS category_id
  ,category
  ,title
  ,views
  ,post_id
FROM
  post_rank
WHERE rank < 3
ORDER BY 
  category
  ,views DESC
  ,post_id
;
