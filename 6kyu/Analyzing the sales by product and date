--Given the information about sales in a store
--calculate the total revenue for each day, month, year, and product.

--Order the result by the product_name, year, month, day columns
--We're interested only in the product-specific data, 
--so you shouldn't return the total revenue from all sales

Solution:

SELECT 
    p.name AS product_name
    ,EXTRACT(YEAR FROM s.date)::INT AS year
    ,EXTRACT(MONTH from s.date)::INT AS month	
    ,EXTRACT(DAY from s.date)::INT AS day	
    ,SUM((p.price*sd.count)) AS total	
FROM sales_details sd	
    INNER JOIN sales s on sd.sale_id = s.id	
    INNER JOIN products p ON sd.product_id = p.id	
GROUP BY 
  Product_name
  ,ROLLUP(year,month,day)	
ORDER BY 
  product_name
  ,year
  ,month
  ,day
