--In baseball, the batting average is a simple and most common way to measure a hitter's performace. 
--Batting average is calculated by taking all the players hits and dividing it by their number of at_bats
--   and it is usually displayed as a 3 digit decimal (i.e. 0.300).

--yankees table: 
--  player_id STRING, player_name STRING, primary_position STRING, games INTEGER, at_bats INTEGER, hits INTEGER

--We want batting_average to be rounded to the nearest thousandth
--Format it as text and make sure it has 3 digits to the right of the decimal (pad with zeroes if neccesary).

--order our resulting table by batting_average, with the highest average in the first row.
--exclude any player who doesn't have at least 100 at bats.

--Expected Output Table: player_name STRING, games INTEGER, batting_average STRING

--Solution:
SELECT
  player_name
  ,games
  ,ROUND((hits::numeric / at_bats),3)::TEXT AS batting_average
FROM 
  yankees
WHERE at_bats >= 100
ORDER BY 
  batting_average DESC
