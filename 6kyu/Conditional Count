--Given a payment table, which is a part of DVD Rental Sample Database, with the following schema
--produce a result set for the report that shows a side-by-side comparison of the number and total amounts of payments made in Mike's and Jon's stores broken down by months.
--The resulting data set should be ordered by month using natural order (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.).
--Note: You don't need to worry about the year component. Months are never repeated because the sample data set contains payment information only for one year.


--Column	       Type	                          Modifiers
--payment_id	   INTEGER	                      NOT NULL
--customer_id    SMALL INT	                    NOT NULL
--staff_id	     SMALL INT	                    NOT NULL
--rental_id	     INTEGER	                      NOT NULL
--amount	       numeric(5,2)	                  NOT NULL
--payment_date	 Timestamp without time zone

--Solution:
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM p.payment_date) AS month
  ,COUNT(*) AS total_count
  ,SUM(p.amount) AS total_amount
  ,SUM(
    CASE	
	    WHEN p.staff_id = 1 THEN 1
	    ELSE 0
    END) AS mike_count
  ,SUM(
    CASE	
	    WHEN p.staff_id = 1 THEN p.amount
	    ELSE 0
    END) AS mike_amount
  ,SUM(
    CASE	
	    WHEN p.staff_id = 2 THEN 1
	    ELSE 0
    END) AS jon_count
  ,SUM(
     CASE	
      WHEN p.staff_id = 2 then p.amount	
      ELSE 0	
     END) AS jon_amount	
FROM payment p	
  INNER JOIN staff s USING(staff_id)	
GROUP BY month	
ORDER BY month;

--Solution Using Filter:
SELECT		
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM payment_date)        AS month,		
  COUNT(*)                                AS total_count,		
  SUM(amount)                             AS total_amount,		
  COUNT(*)    FILTER (WHERE staff_id = 1) AS mike_count,		
  SUM(amount) FILTER (WHERE staff_id = 1) AS mike_amount,		
  COUNT(*)    FILTER (WHERE staff_id = 2) AS jon_count,		
  SUM(amount) FILTER (WHERE staff_id = 2) AS jon_amount		
FROM payment		
GROUP BY month		
ORDER BY month;
