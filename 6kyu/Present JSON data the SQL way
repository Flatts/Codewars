--Given the database where users are stored in JSON format, 
--  fetch the records splitting the data into separate columns.

--The private field determines whether the user's email address should be publicly visible
--If the profile is private, email_address should equal "Hidden"
--The users may have multiple email addresses
--If no email addresses are provided, email_address should equal "None"
--If there're multiple email addresses, the first one should be shown
--The date_of_birth is in the yyyy-mm-dd format
--The age fields represents the user's age in years
--Order the result by the first_name, and last_name columns


--Solution
SELECT 
  data->>'first_name' as first_name
  ,data->>'last_name' as last_name
  ,extract(year from age(now(), (data->>'date_of_birth')::date))::integer as age
  ,CASE
    WHEN data->>'private' = 'true' THEN 'Hidden'
    WHEN data->>'private' = 'false' and data#>>'{email_addresses, 0}' IS NULL THEN 'None'
    ELSE data#>>'{email_addresses, 0}'
   END AS email_address
FROM
  users
ORDER BY 
  first_name
