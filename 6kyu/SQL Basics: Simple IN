For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement, this SELECT statement will use an IN 
to check whether a department has had a sale with a price over 98.00 dollars.

departments table schema			sales table schema			resultant table schema	
id			                      id			                 id	
name			                    department_id (fkey)		 name	
			                        name				
                          		price				
                              card_name				
                              card_number				
                              transaction_date		
                              
                              
 
Solution - using subquery to search for id's in list
SELECT 
  id
  ,name 
 FROM departments
  WHERE id IN (
      SELECT 
        department_id
       FROM sales 
       WHERE price > 98)
