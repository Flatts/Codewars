SELECT 
  p.name AS name
  ,SUM(
      CASE d.detail 
          WHEN 'good' THEN 1 
          ELSE 0
      END) AS good
  ,SUM(
      CASE d.detail
          WHEN 'ok' THEN 1 
          ELSE 0
      END) AS ok
  ,SUM(
      CASE d.detail 
         WHEN 'bad' THEN 1 
         ELSE 0
      END) AS bad
