For this challenge you need to create a simple query to display each unique clan with their total points and ranked by their total points.		
	The query must rank each clan by their total_points,	
	you must return each unqiue clan and if there is no clan name (i.e. it's an empty string) you must replace it with [no clan specified]	
	you must sum the total_points for each clan and the total_people within that clan.	
  
people table schema		      Return table
name		                    rank
points		                  clan
clan		                    total_points
		                        total_people
                            
 
Solution
SELECT 
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(points) DESC) rank
  ,COALESCE(NULLIF(clan,''),'[no clan specified]') AS clan
  ,Count(clan) AS total_people
  ,SUM(points) AS total_points
FROM people
GROUP BY clan
ORDER BY total_points DESC
;

Explanation:  Selects rank by highest points total, if no clan is specified change name otherwise leave the name. 
  count the number of people in the clan and their points grouped
