Oh no! Timmys been moved into the database divison of his software company but as we know Timmy loves making mistakes. 
Help Timmy keep his job by fixing his query...
Timmy works for a statistical analysis company and has been given a task of calculating the highest average salary for a given job, 
the sample is compiled of 100 applicants each with a job and a salary. 
Timmy must display each unique job, the total average salary, the total people and the total salary and order by highest average salary.

people table schema		      job table schema    		resultant table schema	
id		                      id		                  job_title (unique)	
name		                    people_id		            average_salary (float, 2 dp)	
		                        job_title		            total_people (int)	
		                        salary		              total_salary (float, 2 dp)	
Solution:

SELECT
  j.job_title
  ,ROUND(AVG(j.salary),2)::FLOAT as average_salary
  ,COUNT(p.id) as total_people
  ,ROUND(SUM(j.salary),2)::FLOAT as total_salary
FROM people AS p
  JOIN job AS j ON p.id = j.people_id
GROUP BY j.job_title
ORDER BY average_salary DESC

Original Solution:

SELECT
  DISTINCT(j.job_title)
  ,CAST(CAST(ROUND(SUM(j.salary) / COUNT(p),2)AS NUMERIC) AS DOUBLE PRECISION) as average_salary
  ,COUNT(p.id) as total_people
  ,CAST(ROUND(SUM(j.salary),2) AS DOUBLE PRECISION) as total_salary
FROM job j
  INNER JOIN people p
    ON j.id = p.id
GROUP BY j.job_title
ORDER BY average_salary DESC
