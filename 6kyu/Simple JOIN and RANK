--For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table, 
--  and join to the sales table so that you can return the COUNT of all sales and RANK each person by their sale_count.

--people table schema: id, name
--sales table schema: id, people_id, sale, price

--You should return all people fields as well as the sale count as "sale_count" and the rank as "sale_rank".

--Solution - 

SELECT
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(s.price) DESC) AS sale_rank
  ,p.id
  ,p.name AS name
  ,COUNT(*) AS sale_count
FROM 
  sales s
INNER JOIN people p ON s.people_id = p.id
GROUP BY 
  p.id
  ,p.name
