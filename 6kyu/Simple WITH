--For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement, 
--this SELECT statement will use an IN to check whether a department has had a sale with a price over 90.00 dollars
--BUT the sql MUST use the WITH statement which will be used to select all columns from sales
--where the price is greater than 90.00, you must call this sub-query special_sales.

--departments table schema: id, name
--sales table schema: id, department_id, name, price, card_name, card_number, transaction_date
--resultant table schema: id, name

--Solution - 

WITH special_sales AS(
  SELECT 
    s.department_id AS dep_id
  FROM 
    sales s
  WHERE s.price > 90
  GROUP BY s.department_id
  ORDER BY s.department_id
  )
  
SELECT
  * 
FROM 
  departments d
WHERE d.id IN(SELECT dep_id FROM special_sales)
