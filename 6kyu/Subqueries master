--The objective of this Kata is to show that you are proficient at string manipulation 
--  (and perhaps that you can use extensively subqueries).

--You will use people table but will focus solely on the name column

--name
--Greyson Tate Lebsack Jr.
--Elmore Clementina O'Conner
you will be provided with a full name and you have to return the name in columns as follows.

--name	      first_lastname	    second_lastname
--Greyson     Tate	Lebsack	      Jr.
--Elmore	    Clementina	        O'Conner

--Note: Don't forget to remove spaces around names in your result. 
--Note: Due to multicultural context, if full name has more than 3 words, consider first 2 as name

--Solution: 
--Step 3: 
    -- If the name array has 3 items - Select 1 to (3-2) or 1 for first name
    -- If the name array has 4 characters Select 1 to (4-2) or 2 for first name
    -- First Last name will always be in position array length - 1
    -- Second last name will alway be in position of array length
    -- When using a subquery in Postgre there needs to be a variable after the sub q
SELECT
    array_to_string(name[1:len-2],' ') AS name
    ,name[len-1] AS first_lastname
    ,name[len] AS second_lastname
FROM(
----Step 2 - Pair the array version of name with the length of the array
  SELECT
    name
    ,array_length(name,1) AS len
  FROM (
--------Step 1: Convert string to Array for manipulation
      SELECT 
        string_to_array(name,' ') AS name
      FROM
        people) arr) arr_len
