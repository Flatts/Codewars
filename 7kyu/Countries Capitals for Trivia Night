They know that you are a computer nerd, and they want you to query the countries table and get the answers to the trivia questions.		
	The first question: from the African countries that start with the character E, get the names of their capitals ordered alphabetically.	
	You should only give the names of the capitals. Any additional information is just noise	
	If you get more than 3, you will be kicked out, for being too smart	
	Also, this database is crowd-sourced, so sometimes Africa is written Africa and in other times Afrika.	
  
Schema of the countries table:
country (String)
capital (String)
continent (String)

Solution
SELECT * FROM countries c
WHERE c.continent ILIKE 'Afri%'
AND c.country ILIKE 'E%'
ORDER BY c.capital ASC
LIMIT 3
