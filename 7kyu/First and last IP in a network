--Given a table where users' connections are logged,
--  find the first and the last address of the networks they connected from.
--Order the result by the id column
--There's no need to validate anything - it's okay if the user connects from a private network

--Table	          Column	            Type
--Connections	    id	                INT
--	              connection_time	    timestamp
--	              ip_address	        inet

--Return Table
--    Column	            Type
      id	                int
      first_address	      text
      last_address	      text

--Solution - 

SELECT 
  id
  ,network(ip_address) AS first_address
  ,broadcast(ip_address) AS last_address
FROM 
  connections
ORDER BY id
