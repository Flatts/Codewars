--You have access to a table of monsters as follows:

--monsters table schema: id, name, legs, arms, characteristics

--Your task is to make a new table where each column should contain 
--  the length of the string in the column to its right
--  (last column should contain length of string in the first column). 
--Remember some column values are not currently strings. 
--Column order and titles should remain unchanged:

--output table schema: id, name, legs, arms, characteristics

--Solution:  

SELECT 
  char_length(name) AS id
  ,char_length((legs::TEXT)) AS name
  ,char_length((arms::TEXT)) AS legs
  ,char_length(characteristics) AS arms
  ,char_length((id::TEXT)) AS characteristics
FROM
  monsters
