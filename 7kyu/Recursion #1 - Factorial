--In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n,
--  denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. 
  
--For example,  5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
--The value of 0! is 1.

--You have to create the function factorial that receives n and returns n!. You have to use recursion.

--Solution: 

WITH RECURSIVE factorial(n,fact) AS (			
	SELECT
--CAST as BIGINT because Number exceeds INT data type
    CAST(0 AS BIGINT)
    ,CAST (1 AS BIGINT)		
	UNION ALL		
	SELECT
    n+1
    ,(n+1) * fact		
	FROM
    factorial		
	WHERE n < 16		
)			
SELECT 
  n
  ,fact			
FROM
  factorial
