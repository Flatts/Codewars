Your job is to return table with similar structure and headings, where if the sum of a column is odd, the column shows the minimum value for that column, 
and when the sum is even, it shows the max value. You must use a case statement.

Given a table of random numbers as follows:

** numbers table schema **            **output table schema**
id                                       number1
number1                                  number2
number2

Solution:

SELECT
CASE 
  SUM(number1) % 2
    WHEN 0 THEN MAX(number1)
    ELSE MIN(number1)
END AS number1,

CASE
  SUM(number2) % 2
    WHEN 0 THEN MAX(number2)
    ELSE MIN(number2)
END AS number2
FROM numbers
