--You have arrived at the Celadon Gym to battle Erika for the Rainbow Badge.

--She will be using Grass-type Pokemon. 
--Any fire pokemon you have will be strong against grass, but your water types will be weakened. 
--The multipliers table within your Pokedex will take care of that.

--Using the following tables, return the pokemon_name, 
--modifiedStrength and element of the Pokemon whose strength, 
--after taking these changes into account, 
--is greater than or equal to 40, ordered from strongest to weakest.

--pokemon schema: id, pokemon_name, element_id, str
--multipliers schema: id, element, multiplier

--Solution:

SELECT
  p.pokemon_name
  ,p.str * m.multiplier AS modifiedStrength
  ,m.element
FROM 
  pokemon p
INNER JOIN multipliers m on p.element_id = m.id
WHERE (p.str * m.multiplier)>= 40
ORDER BY 
  modifiedStrength DESC
  
--Solution - Practice with Table Expressions

WITH vs_grass AS (
  SELECT
    p.pokemon_name
    ,m.element
    ,(p.str * m.multiplier) AS modifiedStrength
  FROM pokemon p
INNER JOIN multipliers m ON p.element_id = m.id
ORDER BY modifiedStrength DESC
)

SELECT 
  * 
FROM
  vs_grass
WHERE modifiedStrength >= 40
